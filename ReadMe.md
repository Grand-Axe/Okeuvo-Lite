# OkeuvoLite
### Embrace revolution
This repository contains the release of a description of the worlds first and only algorithm for [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) (human-like AI). It is in the "Disclosure" folder.

Artificial general intelligence gives machines the capability of consciousness. This includes the ability to; make judgements based on self interest, to feel sentiments, differentiate good from bad etc.

The release was once a patent application done to keep the IT giants at bay, giving time for vital development work to take place.

The release removes a conflict LushCoin had with its open source definition, as well as with the degree of trust and transparency that the Creed demands.
A bigger conflict was the need to defend an incoming technology with the very patent system it is meant to replace. Thankfully that is now gone.

# Code
Firstly, apologies to those who have had to wait for code a year after the announcement of [LushCoin](https://github.com/Grand-Axe/LushCoin); there were many hiccups along the way.
Code for creating unique hashes for ideas is hosted here (tested on Linux only). This code is the most important component of [LushCoin](https://github.com/Grand-Axe/LushCoin).
The code is at an early stage (buggy and incomplete), but it should be possible to begin hashing simple ideas within a week from today (9th July 2018).

What can idea hashes be used for aside the purposes stated in the [LushCoin white paper](https://github.com/Grand-Axe/LushCoin/raw/master/Docs/LushCoinWhitePaper.pdf)? Imagine your web page having a meta tag with an Okeuvo hash a bit like;

<meta name="okeuvo" content="rtE38jhhd0erqtyquiih920iojd0921j0k020iuhsbh">

That's the ideas in the page summarised in one simple hash ... Bye bye search engine! You will be able to build yours, anybody will be able to build their own search engine.

# Licensing
The code in this repository is dual licensed. For those using or developing for LushCoin and bound by the rules of [The Creed](https://github.com/Grand-Axe/The-Creed), code (except where specified by licenses in the subfolders) is licensed under GPL version 2. For all other purposes, the code in this repository is licensed under the Inverse MIT license.
Simple interpretation, this code is open source based on two conditions.
1. You must be developing for use in LushCoin or be using the code from LushCoin.
2. You must be bound by [The Creed](https://github.com/Grand-Axe/The-Creed).

# Rationale
Dedicated to my late father, who departed this Earth two years to the the artificial general intelligence was made (22nd June 2016) and to my mother whose birthday is the next, 23rd June.

His burial led directly to both this project and LushCoin. I had not been to my home town since childhood and had spent most of my adulthood in the UK. I left the UK for my home town, Otovwodo, Warri, in the oil producing Niger Delta - [one of the 10 most polluted places in the world](http://science.time.com/2013/11/04/urban-wastelands-the-worlds-10-most-polluted-places/slide/niger-river-delta-nigeria/) and met a shocking state of cramped living spaces and decay. Despite the oil.

However, the children eyes were bright with healthy curiosity. Despite the cards dealt them, the people were vigorous. These were people with the ability and energy to succeed, yet who are actively denied the opportunity by a rotten system.

I wondered how I could help lift my people in a country where the value of its currency depends, not on the efforts of its people (and Nigeria has 180 million), but entirely on the international price of oil. Its constitution offers a vivid example of how to build an anticountry, hosting the record phenomenon of six mentions of the phrase "oil and gas".
Oil fuels everything; from a patronage system which erupts into a free flowing fountain of corruption, to cruel government policies that seek to subjugate those unfortunate enough to come from oil producing lands.

The dilemma was real. How to help? I was already writing an artificial general intelligence, [Okeuvo](http://www.mindmutiny.com) and had begun to think of alternate currencies around which to build a stable business framework for people to help themselves. Bitcoin cropped up in my research, but didn't feature very brightly, because I did not know about the blockchain. It is a truly impressive algorithm that crushes the problems of corruption, currency value and the middle man; so two weeks after learning about blockchain, LushCoin was on Github. OkeuvoLite is the hashing component of LushCoin.

Together LushCoin, OkeuvoLite, [Awesome City](https://github.com/Grand-Axe/Awesome-City) and The Creed form an open source, publicly owned framework for the safe delivery of both artificial narrow intelligence and artificial general intelligence.
Diverse areas can be revolutionised by harnessing this framework. Various problems areas can solved as well, such as Funding the NHS in the UK, staving off migration flows into Europe, empowering the downtrodden in developing countries, sending a consciousness owned by all on Earth to Mars and so on.
