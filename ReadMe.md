This repository contains the release of the worlds first and only generally artificial intelligence. It is in the "Disclosure" folder.

General Artificial Intelligence gives machines the capability of free will. This includes the ability to; make judgements based on self interest, to feel sentiments and differentiate good from bad (amongst others).

The release was once a patent application done to keep the IT giants at bay, giving time for vital development work to take place.

The release removes a conflict LushCoin had with its open source definition, as well as with the degree of trust and transparency that the Creed demands.
A bigger conflict was the need to defend an incoming technology with the very patent system it is meant to replace. Thankfully that is now gone.

Code for creating unique hashes for ideas will also be hosted here.

Dedicated to my late father who departed this Earth two years ago on this very day (22nd June 2016) and to my mother whose birthday is 23rd June.
